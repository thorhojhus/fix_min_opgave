Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is at the origin \\((0,0)\\), and the focus is at \\((4,0)\\).\n\nTo draw the parabola, we can choose some values for \\(x\\) and compute the corresponding values for \\(y\\). For example, let's choose \\(x=1\\), then we have \\(y^2 = 16 \\times 1\\), so \\(y^2 = 16\\) and therefore \\(y = \\pm 4\\).
